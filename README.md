# Jackfish Bay Water Health Analysis

## Project Overview
Jackfish Bay, once a pristine lake in Ontario, became a concern in 1987 due to pollution from a pulp mill in Terrace Bay. This project analyzes water and sediment samples collected in 2017 to evaluate environmental health and identify the optimal location for enhancing fish populations, particularly White Sucker fish, which have faced significant declines.

## Objectives
- Conduct water health analysis at four locations:
  - Moberley Bay
  - Tunnel Bay
  - Far Field Bay
  - Far Far Field Bay
- Determine the best location for fish egg incubation.
- Provide actionable recommendations to Ontario’s Ministry of Environment.

## Dataset
### Source
- **Dataset**: [Jackfish Bay Area of Concern in Recovery – Water and Sediment Chemistry](https://data.ontario.ca/dataset/jackfish-bay-area-of-concern-in-recovery-water-and-sediment-chemistry/resource/0b2495bc-8522-4ef9-9c87-fa627f7cabe9)

### Key Attributes
The dataset includes information on water quality, sediment composition, pH levels, dissolved and suspended solids, heavy metals, and organic pollutants.

## Key Findings
- **Nitrogen Levels**: Moberley Bay has the highest nitrogen concentration (1.149 MG/L).
- **Heavy Metals**: Tunnel Bay’s sediment shows the highest average lead concentration (25.4 mg/kg).
- **Clarity**: Tunnel Bay and Far Far Field have the clearest water (4.9 m Secchi depth).
- **pH Levels**: Moberley Bay’s pH is the highest at 8.0.
- **Organic Pollutants**: Moberley Bay recorded the highest contamination with CDD family elements.

## Recommendations
- Focus restoration efforts on **Tunnel Bay**, which offers balanced conditions for aquatic life and fish egg incubation.
- Implement stricter pollution controls in Moberley Bay, targeting nitrogen and CDD reduction.
- Monitor phosphorus levels regularly to prevent eutrophication across all sites.
